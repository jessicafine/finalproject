        <p> My idea for this final project is to create a photography photos that I have taken. My homepage would be a picture that I took with my name next to it. Below my name there would be links with specific information for each page. 

            The first page would be About Me which explains the background of me and how I got into photography. It will show a picture of me with my email next to it. Then, to the left of the image, my text would go there. 

            The second page would be called portraits. This page would have the heading name as Portraits and a small description on the background and process of the images. Then, below it would just be different images between 3-5 pictures. 

            The third page would be called NYC during a pandemic which gives insight on how a large city was impacted by COVID especially during the holidays. </p>
