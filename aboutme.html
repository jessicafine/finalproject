		<h1>About Jessica Fine</h1>
		<img src="aboutme/me.JPG" height="20%" width="20%">
<p> Jessica Fine is a junior Education major at Endicott College with a passion for photography. She first began photography as a freshman in high school at Churchill School and Center, a private institution located in Manhattan, New York City. During her first two years as an undergraduate student at Endicott, Jessica lost her passion because she could not include photography in her busy studies, being on track to become a licensed teacher. At the end of her sophomore year, she realized that she did not want to be a licensed teacher, so instead, she switched her major to Education Studies. That meant that she now had more flexibility with her courses and could take classes that she wanted, including psychology and photography.Her goal is to become a school counselor and to be able to have jobs as a photographer on the side. <br>
	<br> During the summer before her Junior year, Jessica's parents purchased her a Nikon-D3500, a gift she cherishes to this day.Throughout the following winter and spring semester, Jessica took a variety of pictures and regained her passion for the art of photography. The collection that is featured on this website is a inside look of two places that she calls home.</p>
